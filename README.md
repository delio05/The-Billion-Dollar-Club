## Frontend Set Up

The frontend of this project uses HTML, JS, CSS, and custom @webcomponents HTML elements. Read the [frontend guide](Frontend.md) for set-up steps.

## Backend Set Up

The backend of this project uses Django. Read the [backend guide](./Backend.md) to run the backend server.

## Overview

This project was done in partnership with Epic for our CS639: Computer Science Capstone course at UW-Madison. 

This is an AI driven Chrome extension that allows users to highlight text on any webpage that they'd like to simplify into easier to understand language. 
The initial intent was for this to be specefically for complicated medical text and doctor notes left for patients through MyChart, however, we've broadened it such that it can be used for any catagory/page now. 

To use, users can highlight whatever they'd like simplified, and then go to thr Chrome extension. The highlighted text will be displayed there and they can hit the "Summarize" button to simplify. There is also the option to translate to other languages and extract the text to a PDF. Currently with the way the code is set up, users can access the frontend of the extension to see the UI and then run the backend seperatly for access to the full functionality of this extension. 

## What Works & What Doesn't

## Future Steps

Since we only had the scope of one semester to work on this, here are some features and next steps we would implement with more time:
1. Improve UI: 
2. Extend Chatbox Functionality:
3. Privacy Settings:
4. Publish to Chrome Store: 
5. Organize extracted PDF:
