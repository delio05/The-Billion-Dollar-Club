<h4>SUBJECTIVE:</h4>
<p>Patient presents for evaluation of fatigue. Patient has been followed here in the past for hypertension and hypothyroidism but has been less than optimally compliant with medication recommendations and regular follow-up. His original diagnosis of hypothyroidism was made following the development of fatigue and the patient is wondering if his thyroid is again â€œout of whack." He indicates that he has taken his Synthroid on a regular basis even though he has cut back on his blood pressure medicine. He notes occasional cold intolerance but this is no different than his lifelong pattern. He notes occasional mild constipation but denies melena or hematochezia. Weight has been stable. No skin or hair symptoms.
Hypertension -- Because of concerns with fatigue the patient decreased his blood pressure medication to every second to third day.</p>

<p>He has not taken his blood pressure at home. Exercise is sporadic. He denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or peripheral edema. He indicates that he understands and there are risks associated with hypertension but "hates taking all that medicine."
Hypercholesterolemia - patient is currently on Zocor 40 mg today. He indicates that he takes this medication most days although he may occasionally forget. He denies any side effects that he attributes to the Zocor although wonders aloud whether maybe that is a cause of his fatigue.</p>

<h4>ASSESSMENT/PLAN:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>MALAISE AND FATIGUE (primary encounter diagnosis)<br>
    Note: rule out hypothyroidism. If TSH is normal, will not pursue further workup at this time</li>
  <li>ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION<br>
    Note: Medication compliance remains a significant issue. I have reinforced the need to control blood pressure to minimize.</li>
</ol>
